# `freebox_port_forwarding` (Resource)

Manages a port forwarding between a local network host and the Freebox Internet Gateway

## Example

```terraform
resource "freebox_port_forwarding" "example" {
  enabled          = true
  ip_protocol      = "udp"
  target_ip        = "192.168.1.255"
  comment          = "This is an example comment"
  source_ip        = "0.0.0.0"
  port_range_start = 32443
  port_range_end   = 32443
  target_port      = 443
}

output "hostname" {
  value = resource.freebox_port_forwarding.example.hostname
}

output "reachable" {
  value = resource.freebox_port_forwarding.example.host.reachable
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Status of the forwarding
- `ip_protocol` (String) Protocol to handle
- `port_range_start` (Number) Start boundary of the port range to forward. The range is inclusive.
- `target_ip` (String) Local IP of the local port forwarding target

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Additional comment associated with the rule
- `port_range_end` (Number) End boundary of the port range to forward. If not set, it will default to the same value as `port_range_start`.
- `source_ip` (String) Local IP of the local port forwarding target. If left unset or set to 0.0.0.0, the rule will apply to any incoming IP
- `target_port` (Number) The target port range to forward to. If not set, it will default to the same value as `port_range_start`. Only available for a range of 1 port.

### Read-Only

- `host` (Attributes) LAN host information (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host))
- `hostname` (String) Name of the target host in the local network
- `id` (Number) Unique identifier of the port forwarding

### Nested Schema for `host`

Optional:

- `default_name` (String) Default name of the host
- `host_type` (String) When possible, the Freebox will try to guess the host_type, but you can manually override this to the correct value
- `persistent` (Boolean) If true the host is always shown even if it has not been active since the Freebox startup
- `primary_name` (String) Host primary name (chosen from the list of available names, or manually set by user)

Read-Only:

- `active` (Boolean) If true the host sends traffic to the Freebox
- `first_activity_seconds` (Number) First time the host sent traffic, or null if it wasnâ€™t seen before this field was added.
- `id` (String) ID of the host
- `interface` (String) Interface of the host
- `l2ident` (Attributes) Layer 2 network id and its type (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host--l2ident))
- `l3connectivities` (Attributes List) List of available layer 3 network connections (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host--l3connectivities))
- `names` (Attributes List) List of available names, and their source (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host--names))
- `network_control` (Attributes) If device is associated with a profile, contains profile summary. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host--network_control))
- `primary_name_manual` (Boolean) If true the primary name has been set manually
- `reachable` (Boolean) If true the host can receive traffic from the Freebox
- `vendor_name` (String) Host vendor name (from the mac address)

### Nested Schema for `host.l3connectivities`

Optional:

- `active` (Boolean) Whether the L3 connectivity is active
- `address` (String) Address of the L3 connectivity
- `reachable` (Boolean) Whether the L3 connectivity is reachable
