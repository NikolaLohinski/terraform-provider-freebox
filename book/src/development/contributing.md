### Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch or a new feature?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the changes.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Make sure you have covered the bug with a unit test, or have at least explained how you would make it testable.

### Do you have questions about the source code or want to contribute?

Feel free to open an issue and ask about it!
